// This file is used in production to server generated JS assets. In development mode, we use the Webpack Dev Server
// to provide assets. This allows for hot reloading of the JS and CSS.
// See app/helpers/application_helper.rb for how the correct assets file is picked based on the Rails environment.
// Those helpers are used here: app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

// These assets are located in app/assets/webpack directory

// Non-webpack assets incl turbolinks
//= require application_non_webpack
